kqizx6p,"One thing we talked about is on some days, she gives 70% and I give 30%. Some days, I give 70 and she's 30. The issue here is when we both only have 30% to give, who covers the 40. My response to that is luckily, our kids are old enough and independent enough where we can let them play outside for an hour or let them watch a movie and they can grab their own snack so we can take that break.

Unfortunately, while I'm at work, I don't get to tell my customers to turn on the TV, I'll be back after a nap. Don't get me wrong, my wife is an iron woman dealing with these kids. Like I said, she's been SAH since our first born so there was a time when we had all 3 under five in diapers or trainers and she had to tackle it by herself. Like I've said, I genuinely feel like I have the easier role.

l52i67s,"Thanks for your response, I appreciate the feedback. Couple of things to clarify:

1. My parents came to see the baby AND to help out with any chores around the house. They also brought us dinner every single time they came. Additionally they offered to let us nap for a couple of hours while they watched the baby in the house, which my wife refused (she does not trust anyone to watch the baby, which has been a separate issue).

2. My wife does not even need to be present when my mom comes over. She does not need to be the hostess. In fact, I've told her to do the gym, nap, run errands, visit friends, whatever she wants. She insists on staying in the house and being around my mom since -- again -- she doesn't want anyone watching the baby other than herself or me.

3. My parents have taken vacations lasting up to a month since the baby was born, so my wife has absolutely had a break from my family. Additionally we've gone out of town a few times as well, so the twice a week is an average, not a consistent every week no matter what.

leio61b,"The thought crossed my mind. But when I look at it from his perspective, he's been in a past relationship where she was very unfaithful and it destroyed him. The burning dick really could be from a yeast infection or weird postpartum infection, idk. What if he really just thinks it's an std because Google told him so? Maybe he really is concerned I cheated on him and went about it all wrong, I just don't know what to think. Because we both also work in healthcare, he knows there are other things that can cause those symptoms. Even though it feels like proof, it's not, and i have nothing else to go on (unless there really is a std). I do love him, and I do have a child with him, I don't want to go ruining everything completely over a questionable accusation. 

The financial dependency doesn't bother me. He's younger than me, never went to college, I knew this. It bothers him, and I know it makes him feel a certain way. Right now I'm working while he stays home with the baby for the most part. Once things settle, he wants to go to college part time, and I'm okay with all of this. It only became a problem when he was spending his money on pills when I was paying for everything, that was not okay, but I know he had a real problem. 

I'm not okay with the stealing, he finally did buy me a safe after the last incidient. Which I guess at least he's trying. But things were getting close to the end because of that one. 

He didn't give me any inclination that he would do anything if I didn't have sex with him 3 weeks pp, he didn't push me. I felt very insecure and was compensating, and after the first time my sex drive came back. 

Ik I'm making a lot of excuses right now, I'm trying to wrap my head around this. It's all been a lot. He's said plenty that if I leave him, he will be moving on.

I’ve always made it clear that I appreciate everything he has ever done for me though. Face to face, in love letters, in texts and calls. I’m not expecting anything more from him and I never complain about any of the effort he puts in. Financially or when it comes to chores or whatever else.

He just doesn’t see anything I do. He’ll say ”thank you for doing this and that” in the moment, which I don’t even expect, but when he’s angry, he’ll go to these extremes where he says I’m not generous, I’m rude, I’m stupid and whatever. Often says that I don’t do enough and I have a problem with chores. I don’t though, I’m doing things for him (and my mom) all the time, everyday. Big and small.

No, her father never said that. Even if he was caught in the act of cheating he either kept quiet or denied it. Even if from the outside denying it was incredibly stupid and it was obvious to everyone that he cheated, he denied it. That's why I confessed to my wife right away that I had cheated.
